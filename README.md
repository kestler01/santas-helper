# Santa's Helper
## Overview
This is a full stack application where users can create wish lists of Christmas gifts and denote whether each item has been bought and wrapped. Users will also be able to keep a "wishlist for Santa" called "Santa's Secrets".

## Deployed Link
TBD

## Technology Used
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Mongoose
  - MongoDB
  - Express.js
  - React 
  - Node 
  - Bootstrap

(for alternate backend)
  - Python
  - Django

## User Stories
As a user I want the ability to...
  - sign in  or register
  - make a wishlist for each of my loved ones
  - see one wishlist
  - see all wishlists
  - add wishlists
  - delete wishlists
  - update wishlists
  - add gifts to wishlists 
  - delete gifts
  - update gifts
  - mark whether a gift has been bought
  - mark whether a gift has been wrapped
  - make a Santas Secrets List for each of my loved ones that's related to their wishlist 

## Stretch	Goals
- add a field for where the gift is stored
- have a checkbox where the user can chose an image to go with the wish list: either a candy-cane, christmas tree, or a gift box

## Version 2
- add a field for where the gift is stored
- have a checkbox where the user can chose an image to go with the wish list: either a candy-cane, christmas tree, or a gift box
- make it so users can upload pictures of the recipients to go with their wish lists
- make it so the gifts show up in separate fields so they can individually be marked as bought or wrapped, rather than all or nothing
- style the Santa's Secrets so it looks more like a roll of parchment and so that the messages become one big message, rather than individual messages
- have Santa's Secrets pop out from the right rather than the left and switch which side the Santa's Secrets button is on.

## MVP
- An app that looks and functions on a basic level; with a navigation bar, div boxes that display the users wish lists for their loved ones, the capability to update and delete said lists, as well as make secret lists for stocking stuffers (Santa's Secrets).
